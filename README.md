Eksamen

Final Project - Sources
We created our logo with the use of Photoshop. The same thing applies to the app and machine sketches. We at Green Routine wish to make a future collaboration with these partners: “Norsk Gjenvinning”, Oslo Municipality and “Fretex”. We hope that by having these partners that we can potentially make Green Routine a reality in the future. At this point in time we do not have a cooperation with these partners yet, but we are in the process of establishing contact with them.  We are also in the process of establishing contact with these potential future sponsors: “Coop”, “Narvesen”, “Oslo bysykkel” to Green Routine.
